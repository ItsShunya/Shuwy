<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Trying to choose a suitable bot for some general project discords was always a tiresome activity, seeing bots with too many useless features, or more likely focused in really concise targets. Shuwy is a bot which provides some general **moderation** features, together with **automation** capabilities such as setting a role for new members or welcoming them. It also features a powerful graphical **music** player to allow the users have a full experience bot.
